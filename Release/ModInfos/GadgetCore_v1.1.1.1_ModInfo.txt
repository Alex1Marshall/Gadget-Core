Gadget Core is a mod that is meant to serve as a unified core for other mods that wish to add new content to use.
The goal is to simplify the process of adding new items, creatures, and more to the game, and simultaneously minimize the chances of mod conflicts.

It currently unifies:
 - Items
 - Chips
 - Tiles
 - Entities (Enemies)
To do:
 - Projectiles
 - Hazards
 - Races
 - Augments	
 - Outfits
 - World Objects
 - Worlds

And it also provides the following additional features:
 - An in-game mod configuration menu.
 - Mod synchronization across the network.
 - It installs the Mono Patch into your game automatically, so that you do not have to do it yourself.
 - It is able to unpack mod .zips with the click of a button, simplifying the process.
 - It is able to automatically use UPnP to port-forward your game, if your router supports it. (Currently bugged - disabled by default)

Bugs in the current version:
 - UPnP doesn't actually seem to work. Enable at your own risk in the config file. If you take this risk and it works correctly for you, please contact SuperKael and send him your GadgetCore log file.
 - The 'Disable Gadget' option in the mod menu doesn't persist after the restart, thereby making it impossible to disable Gadget mods without disabling the entire UMF mod.

You can package multiple mods into one .zip file to create a simple sort of modpack.
You can also place folders such as Configs into the zip to distribute those as well.
