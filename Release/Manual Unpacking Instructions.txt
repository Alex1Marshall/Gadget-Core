There are various circumstances were you may wish to manually unpack a mod, such as Gadget Core. An example of such a situation would be if you are not running Windows.
This file is purely informational, and explains how to manually unpack .zip mods. These instructions are subject to change as Gadget Core updates.

First, extract the contents of the .zip into the /Roguelands/uModFramework/Mods folder.
Then, if you previously had the .zip in the Mods folder, delete the zip - if you had the zip somewhere else, it does not matter.

If the Mods folder now contains folders named 'Tools' and/or 'CoreLibs', then there is an extra step for each.
In the case of Tools: Copy (and replace as needed) its contents to /Roguelands/uModFramework/Tools, and then delete the Tools folder within Mods.
In the case of CoreLibs: Copy (and replace as needed) its contents to /Roguelands/Roguelands_Data/Managed, and then delete the CoreLibs folder within Mods.

And with that, you are done.
