Gadget Core is a mod that is meant to serve as a unified core for other mods that wish to add new content to use.
The goal is to simplify the process of adding new items, creatures, and more to the game, and simultaneously minimize the chances of mod conflicts.

It currently unifies:
 - Items
 - Chips
 - Tiles
 - Creatures

And it also provides the following additional features:
 - An in-game mod configuration menu.
 - A helper class for patching Coroutines.
